## Tools & Technologies

- *Jenkins*: Continuous Integration (CI) server to automatically run API tests on code commits or at scheduled intervals.
- *RestAssured*: Java library for automated testing of REST APIs.


## Test Scenarios

### 1. RestAssured Automation
*RestAssured* is used for writing automated tests in Java. It simplifies validating REST APIs, allowing programmatic assertions on status codes, response bodies, headers, and more.

## Conclusion
This project automates API testing of the Platzi Fake API using RestAssured. With automated testing integrated into CI/CD, we can ensure that the API is consistently reliable and performs well over time.
